## System Dependencies

Dependency is a broad software engineering term used to refer when a software replies on another one. For R package dependencies, the installation on the `synapser` package will take care of installing other R packages that `synapser` depends on. However, system dependencies which are lower level software packages are not being installed at this time.

Most Windows and Mac machines have the required system dependencies. Linux machines and EC2 users will need to configure their machines before installing `synapser`.

### Required System Dependencies

* libssl-dev
* libcurl-dev
* libffi-dev
* zlib-dev

To install these system dependencies on Ubuntu machines:
```
apt-get update -y

```

Or use our provided [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapser/blob/master/Dockerfile).
