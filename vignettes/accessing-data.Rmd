## Accessing Data

Synapse identifiers are used to refer to projects and data which are represented by 
*entity* objects. For example, the entity syn1899498 represents a tab-delimited file 
containing a 100 by 4 matrix. Getting the entity retrieves an object that holds metadata 
describing the matrix, and also downloads the file to a local cache:

```{r}
library(synapser)
synLogin()
entity <- synGet('syn1899498')
```

View the entityâ€™s metadata in the R console:

```{r}
print(entity)
```

This is one simple way to read in a small matrix:

```{r}
read.table(entity$path)
```

View the entity in the browser:

```{r}
synOnweb('syn1899498')
```


This should 'break' the vignette:

```{r}
#stop("an intentionally generated error")
```
